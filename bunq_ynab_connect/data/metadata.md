# Introduction
The [metadata folder](/bunq_ynab_connect/metadata) contains metadata for all datasets that are used. It contains information like name, key column and timestamp column. The [Metadata class](/bunq_ynab_connect/data/metadata.py) is used to load this metadata. It is injected upon load of the module, and reads all metadata into a list of [TableMetadata](/bunq_ynab_connect/data/table_metadata.py) objects. [Storage](/bunq_ynab_connect/data/storage) uses it to read / write the data correctly, and maintain runmoments. By using this metadata, a table needs only to be identified by its `name` for the storage to expose functionality like upsert and delete.
